# Online Quiz Application Using Python Tkinter

A Quiz application using Python Tkinter would be a program that uses the Tkinter
library to create a graphical user interface for a quiz. Tkinter is a built-in Python
library for creating desktop applications, and it provides a set of tools for creating
forms, buttons, labels, and other widgets.

To create a Quiz application using Tkinter, you could first design a layout for
the quiz using Tkinter's widgets. This could include creating a window with a title,
labels for the question and answer choices, and buttons for submitting answers.
Then, you would need to write code to handle the logic of the quiz, such as
displaying questions, checking answers, and keeping track of the user's score.
